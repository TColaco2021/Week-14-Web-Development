In this unit, I learned about web application architecture and the web client-server model HTTP communication process.

On Day 1 we covered the HTTP communication process in the web client-server model. We will then look at how sessions are managed by web applications using cookies.

On Day 2 we covered the modern web application architecture, web application software "stacks," how to deploy web application container sets, and how to create SQL queries to manage data in databases.
